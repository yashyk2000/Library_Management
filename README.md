# Library_Management
Built an GUI Application using Netbeans IDE as Frontend and MySQl as backend. 
The application accepts user details which are stored at backend and also takes a unique administration Number to every student who accesses the library. 
List of books which are already stored in the database is displayed to the user to choose the book.
This application allows the registered librarian to issue a book to the student and take back.
